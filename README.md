# the-Blocky-game-on-Python
This is "the Blocky game" implemented with Python
Blocky is a game with simple moves on a simple structure, but like a Rubik’s Cube, it is quite challenging to play. The game is played on a randomly-generated game board made of squares of four different colours.
In this game, user with play against a "SmartPlayer" who has a “difficulty” level, which indicates how difficult it is to play against it. The difficulty level is an integer >= 0, and dictates how many possible moves it compares when choosing a move to make. For example, if difficulty is 0, it compares 5 possible moves.
